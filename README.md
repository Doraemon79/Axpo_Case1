Report generator


CLI start:

in the folder of ReportGeneratorApp type dotnet run and the preferred input example:
--outputPath "./reportsDirectory/" --interval 5 --timezone "America/New_York"

Time offset is calculated based on the region.
It can execute one day by time.

Comments:
Test coverage is 88%  with longer tme I would have made the classes differently to increase the coverage
